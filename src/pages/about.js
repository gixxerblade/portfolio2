      <StyH2>
        Iâ€™m a product focused Javascript developer and entrepreneur based in
        North Carolina. After my tenure with Marine Corps, I shifted focus to
        the technology sector and obtained a Bachelors of Science in Information
        Technology. Not one to leave anything to chance, along with the passion
        to become the best version of me, I signed up for a program named{" "}
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          style={{ color: "#1c6e8c" }}
          href="www.vetswhocode.io"
        >
          Vets Who Code
        </a>
        . I went through their course work to learn not only how to become a
        better programmer but to actually understand the craft of building
        products for the web with a{" "}
        <span style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}>team</span>. When I was
        not learning I focused on building a company named{" "}
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          style={{ color: "#1c6e8c" }}
          href="www.angrypickles.com"
        >
          Angry Pickles.
        </a>
        . I am proud to have built a product from scratch that actually provides
        revenue and makes people happy. When I am not building, learning or
        making pickles, I am an avid Cyclist and Gardener.
